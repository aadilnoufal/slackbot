🐱 PersianCatBot: The Ultimate Slack Prank! 🐱

Welcome to the wildest Slack prank of the year!
PersianCatBot is a cleverly disguised bot that took the Hack Club Slack community by storm, creating hilarious chaos and unforgettable reactions. This bot is a replica of the real Arcade Monitor bot, complete with the same name, profile picture, and all the bells and whistles—only this one has a knack for adding virtual Persian cats to the gift inventory. 😸

🎯 The Backstory
In our Hack Club Slack, the Arcade Monitor bot keeps us all updated about the latest stock changes in our community arcade. But some members got creative and started sending fake stock messages from their own accounts. That’s when I decided to take things up a notch.

The Plan
Create a Fake Bot: I built a bot that mimics the Arcade Monitor, matching it perfectly in appearance and behavior.
Join the Fun: Added the bot to the Arcade Monitor channel.
Execute the Prank: Sent out two messages—one announcing that a Persian cat had been added to the gifts (which got a whopping 133 responses), and another updating the cat’s stock count. To seal the deal, I even edited the HTML to show a fake screenshot of the cat in the gifts section.
And yes, I had permission from the chat admin for this prank—so no worries, it was all in good fun! 😉
